# Keystone Stress-Test Report — URL Shortener (from note)

> Accuracy level **L0 (Directional)**. Decision support, **not** certification. Numbers come from the deterministic engine; the council reasons about design and is constrained and scrubbed to keep figures out of its output (best-effort, not a guarantee). Read *Where this is wrong* before trusting a number.

**Offered load:** 100 req/s — placeholder workload (stub — document not read)
**Overall confidence:** medium-high (lightly loaded; estimates most reliable here)

## Verdict

- **Bottleneck:** App server (utilisation 10%)
- **Max sustainable load:** ~850 req/s at the 85% safe ceiling · ~1,000 req/s theoretical
- **Latency (dominant path):** p50 ~12 ms · p95 ~52 ms · p99 ~80 ms (mean 17 ms)
- **Single points of failure:** Load balancer, Primary database
- **Estimated compute cost:** ~$0/month

## Component load

| Component | Arrival (rps) | Capacity (rps) | Utilisation | Mean svc (ms) | Status |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--|
| App server | 100 | 1,000 | 10% | 11.1 | ok |
| Primary database | 100 | 2,000 | 5% | 5.3 | ok |
| Load balancer | 100 | 20,000 | 0% | 1.0 | ok |

## Design decisions (council)

> _Council running in DETERMINISTIC STUB mode — illustrative ADRs, not live reasoning. Provide a Claude API key to activate the real consensus engine._

### Datastore — confidence: high
**Decision:** Single relational primary (PostgreSQL) for the mapping table.

**Rationale:** Workload is simple key->value with strong-read tolerance once cached; a relational primary is the boring, reliable default.

**Recorded dissent:**
- Data engineer: a KV store (DynamoDB) scales writes more cheaply at very high create volume; revisit if write share rises.

**Kill criteria (revisit this decision if):**
- Create (write) traffic exceeds ~30% of total
- Mapping table exceeds single-primary write capacity

### Caching — confidence: high
**Decision:** Cache-aside on the redirect (read) path with a high hit-rate cache.

**Rationale:** Redirects dominate traffic and are highly cacheable; the cache shields the primary from the read storm.

**Recorded dissent:**
- SRE: the cache is now load-bearing -- a cold cache or stampede melts the DB. Add request-coalescing / stampede protection.

**Kill criteria (revisit this decision if):**
- Cache hit-rate falls below ~70% in production
- No stampede protection before launch

### Resilience — confidence: med
**Decision:** Add a read replica and cache failover before production.

**Rationale:** A single primary and single cache are single points of failure.

**Recorded dissent:**
- YAGNI-skeptic: acceptable to defer for a prototype (Tier-0), but NOT for external traffic (Tier-1).

**Kill criteria (revisit this decision if):**
- Going to external/production traffic with 1 DB + 1 cache

## Where this is wrong (read before trusting a number)

- Analytical queueing approximation (M/M/1 per component), not a discrete-event simulation. Async/streaming/multi-region topologies are out of v1 scope.
- Component capacities are SEED benchmarks tagged ASSUMPTION, not calibrated to your stack. Accuracy is L0 (Directional) until field-calibrated (Doc 03).
- Percentiles use an exponential-tail approximation and tend to OVER-state the tail; treat p95/p99 as upper-bound directional figures.
- Cost is compute/instance only; data-transfer/egress and managed-service pricing nuances are not yet modelled.
- Bottleneck identification and the relative ordering of components are far more reliable than absolute latency/cost numbers.
